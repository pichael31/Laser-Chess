# Laser Chess
 Laser Chess Game, as seen on The Genius.

Currently only works PvP Co-op, rotate pieces using EQ and move by clicking on highlighted cells.  White (player 1, player on the right) goes first.  Lasers move incredibly slow when running this, and I'm not sure why, but testing is difficult bc it runs much faster in Unity (speeding it up messes with how it interacts with pieces).  Also might only work on Windows and 1920 x 1080.
